Why ShareThis?

The reason of using [ShareThis](https://sharethis.com/) as [AddThis](https://www.addthis.com/) has announced service termination end May onwards.

Hence, the team has decided to look for alternative solution and ShareThis caught our eyeballs.

## Steps to setup

1. Register an account via the [onboarding](https://sharethis.com/onboarding/)

2. Select one of the Sharing tools

  c/ Large size

  d/ No label, no counts, zero corners, no extra spacing

  e/ English language

  a/ script-src - platform-api.sharethis.com and buttons-config.sharethis.com
  
  b/ connect-src - l.sharethis.com

  c/ img-src - platform-cdn.sharethis.com

10. Final result look
